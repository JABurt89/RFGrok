### Problem Description

When you attempt to run your app, you encounter the following error in the console:

```
11:03:59 PM [vite] Pre-transform error: /home/runner/workspace/client/src/components/workout-logger.tsx: Missing semicolon. (35:3)

  33 | ```
  34 | 
> 35 | ```typescript
     |    ^
  36 | // client/src/components/workout/base-workout-logger.tsx
  37 | import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
  38 | import { useQuery, useQueryClient, useMutation } from "@tanstack/react-query";
```

This error is generated by Vite, the build tool used in your project, indicating a syntax issue in the file `client/src/components/workout-logger.tsx` at line 35, column 3. The problematic line contains ````typescript`, which is typically a markdown code block marker, not valid TypeScript or JSX syntax in a `.tsx` file.

### Cause of the Error

The presence of markdown code block markers (e.g., ````` and ````typescript`) in a `.tsx` file is invalid syntax. Vite, which uses esbuild to transform TypeScript and JSX files, expects the file to contain only valid TypeScript or JSX code. The error message "Missing semicolon" is likely a misinterpretation by the parser due to encountering unexpected markdown syntax, which disrupts the expected code structure.

### Solution

To resolve this error, you need to ensure that `client/src/components/workout-logger.tsx` contains only valid TypeScript and JSX code by removing or properly commenting out the markdown code block markers. Below are clear, actionable steps to fix the issue.

---

### Actionable Instructions

#### Step 1: Open the File
- Locate and open the file `client/src/components/workout-logger.tsx` in your code editor. This file is within the `client/src/components/` directory of your project.

#### Step 2: Locate the Problematic Code
- Navigate to line 35 in `workout-logger.tsx`. Based on the error output, line 35 contains:
  ```
  ```typescript
  ```
- You may also find a preceding line (e.g., line 33) with:
  ```
  ```
  ```
- These lines are markdown code block markers, which are not valid in a `.tsx` file unless they are part of a comment or string.

#### Step 3: Remove or Comment Out the Markdown Markers
- **Option 1: Remove the Markers**
  If these lines are not intended to be part of the code (e.g., they were accidentally included from documentation or a copy-paste error), delete them entirely. For example, if your file looks like this:
  ```typescript
  // client/src/components/workout-logger.tsx
  ```
  
  ```
  ```typescript
  // client/src/components/workout/base-workout-logger.tsx
  import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
  ```
  Remove the markdown lines so it becomes:
  ```typescript
  // client/src/components/workout-logger.tsx
  // client/src/components/workout/base-workout-logger.tsx
  import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
  ```

- **Option 2: Comment Out the Markers**
  If the markdown is part of a comment or documentation within the file and you want to keep it, ensure it is properly commented out using TypeScript comment syntax (`//` or `/* */`). For example:
  - Using single-line comments:
    ```typescript
    // ```
    // ```typescript
    // client/src/components/workout/base-workout-logger.tsx
    import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
    ```
  - Using a multi-line comment:
    ```typescript
    /*
    ```
    ```typescript
    */
    // client/src/components/workout/base-workout-logger.tsx
    import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
    ```

#### Step 4: Verify Surrounding Code
- Check the lines before and after line 35 (e.g., lines 30–40) to ensure there are no additional syntax errors, such as:
  - Unclosed comments (e.g., `/*` without `*/`)
  - Missing semicolons in actual code statements
  - Unclosed strings or template literals
- For example, ensure that the import statements and any preceding code are syntactically correct:
  ```typescript
  import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
  import { useQuery, useQueryClient, useMutation } from "@tanstack/react-query";
  ```

#### Step 5: Save the File
- After making the changes, save `client/src/components/workout-logger.tsx`.

#### Step 6: Restart the Development Server
- Stop your current Vite development server (e.g., press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal).
- Restart it by running:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```
- Check the console output to confirm that the error no longer appears.

#### Step 7: Test the Application
- Once the server restarts without errors, test your app (e.g., navigate to the workout logger feature) to ensure it functions as expected.

### Example of a Corrected File

Here’s what a corrected version of `workout-logger.tsx` might look like, assuming it was intended to include the imports shown in the error:

```typescript
// client/src/components/workout-logger.tsx
// Reference to base-workout-logger.tsx for shared logic
import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import { useQuery, useQueryClient, useMutation } from "@tanstack/react-query";

// Add your component logic here
export default function WorkoutLogger() {
  // Example implementation
  const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Workout Logger</h1>
      {/* Add your JSX here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

- The markdown markers have been removed or commented out, and only valid TypeScript/JSX remains.

### Additional Notes

- **If the Error Persists:**
  - Double-check for syntax errors elsewhere in the file (e.g., missing brackets, unclosed strings) that might confuse the parser.
  - Run the TypeScript compiler directly to get more detailed feedback:
    ```bash
    npx tsc --noEmit
    ```
  - Share the full content of `workout-logger.tsx` if you need further assistance.

- **Why This Happened:**
  - The markdown syntax (e.g., ````typescript`) might have been copied from documentation or a code example into the `.tsx` file by mistake. `.tsx` files should only contain executable code, not markdown.

- **Preventing Future Issues:**
  - Ensure that documentation or example code is kept separate (e.g., in `.md` files) and not mixed into source files.

### Conclusion

By removing or commenting out the invalid markdown code block markers in `client/src/components/workout-logger.tsx`, you will resolve the Vite pre-transform error. Follow the steps above, and your app should run without this syntax issue. If you encounter further problems, feel free to provide more details for additional support!
