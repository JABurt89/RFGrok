### Answer to Your Query

It looks like you’re encountering an error after modifying your `storage.ts` file:

```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find package 'postgres' imported from /home/runner/workspace/server/storage.ts
```

This error occurs because the `postgres` package, which you’ve imported in your `storage.ts` file, is not installed in your project. Let’s break down the issue and provide a clear solution.

#### Why This Error Happens
In your updated `storage.ts` file, you’ve added the following line:

```javascript
import postgres from "postgres";
```

This import is used to create a PostgreSQL client:

```javascript
const client = postgres(connectionString);
```

The `postgres` package is a dependency required for your application to connect to a PostgreSQL database using `drizzle-orm/postgres-js`. However, Node.js cannot find this package because it hasn’t been installed in your project’s `node_modules` directory.

#### How to Fix It
To resolve this error, you need to install the `postgres` package. Since your project appears to be using TypeScript and is likely managed with npm (based on the `npm run dev` command), you can install it with the following steps:

1. **Install the `postgres` Package**:
   Open a terminal in your project directory and run:

   ```bash
   npm install postgres
   ```

   If you’re using Yarn instead of npm, you can run:

   ```bash
   yarn add postgres
   ```

   This command will:
   - Download and install the `postgres` package.
   - Automatically add it to the `dependencies` section of your `package.json` file.

2. **Verify the Installation**:
   After running the command, check your `package.json` file to ensure `postgres` is listed under `dependencies`. It should look something like this:

   ```json
   "dependencies": {
     "postgres": "^3.3.5",
     // other dependencies
   }
   ```

3. **Run Your Application**:
   Once the package is installed, try running your application again:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The error should disappear, and your application should start successfully.

#### Additional Context
- **Environment**: The error path `/home/runner/workspace` suggests you might be running this in a remote environment like GitHub Codespaces or a CI/CD runner. If you’re working in such an environment, ensure you run the `npm install postgres` command in the terminal of that environment. After installation, the updated `package.json` should be committed to your repository to ensure the dependency is included in future runs.
- **Local Development**: If you’re developing locally and then pushing changes to a remote environment, install the package locally first and commit the updated `package.json`.
- **TypeScript Support**: The `postgres` package includes built-in TypeScript types, so you don’t need to install additional type definitions.

#### Confirming the Fix
After installing `postgres`, Node.js should be able to resolve the import statement in `storage.ts`, and your database connection logic should work as expected. If you still encounter issues, double-check:
- That the package name is correctly spelled in both the import statement and `package.json`.
- That your internet connection allowed the package to download successfully during installation.

#### Summary
The error is caused by a missing dependency (`postgres`) that your updated code relies on. Installing it with `npm install postgres` (or `yarn add postgres`) will resolve the issue. This is a straightforward fix, and once applied, your application should run without the `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` error.
