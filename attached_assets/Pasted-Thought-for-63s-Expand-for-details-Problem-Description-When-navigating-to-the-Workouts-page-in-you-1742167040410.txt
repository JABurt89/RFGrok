This is a pre-transform error reported by Vite, indicating that during the build process, it encountered a duplicate declaration of the identifier STSParameters. This typically means that within the same file or scope, STSParameters is declared more than once, which is not allowed in TypeScript.

Analysis
The error points to line 44 in a file (likely client/src/pages/workouts-page.tsx, since the crash occurs on the "Workouts" page), where multiple types, including STSParameters, are imported from "@shared/schema". The file shared/schema.ts defines STSParameters as:

export type STSParameters = z.infer<typeof stsParameters>;
where stsParameters is a Zod schema defined earlier in the same file. There’s no duplicate definition of STSParameters within schema.ts itself, so the issue likely arises in the file importing it.

In TypeScript, importing a type should not cause a duplicate declaration error unless there’s a naming conflict with another declaration (e.g., a variable, constant, or another type) in the same scope. The error being a "pre-transform error" suggests it occurs during Vite’s transformation phase, possibly due to how esbuild (used by Vite for fast TypeScript processing) interprets the code.

Given the project structure and the error, the most likely cause is a naming conflict in workouts-page.tsx (or a component it uses) between the imported type STSParameters and a local declaration (e.g., a variable, constant, or type) with the same name.

Steps to Resolve the Issue
Since the full content of workouts-page.tsx isn’t provided, I’ll outline actionable steps based on the most probable cause—a naming conflict—and how to address it.

Step 1: Locate the Problematic File
File: The error likely occurs in client/src/pages/workouts-page.tsx, as it corresponds to the "Workouts" page where the crash happens.
Action: Open workouts-page.tsx in your code editor.
Step 2: Check for Duplicate Declarations
Task: Search for any local declarations named STSParameters within workouts-page.tsx.
Examples of Conflicts:
A variable: const STSParameters = ...;
A type: type STSParameters = ...;
A function or constant: let STSParameters = ...;
Why: In TypeScript, types and variables share the same namespace within a scope. If STSParameters is both imported as a type and declared locally (e.g., as a variable), this causes a duplicate declaration error.
Step 3: Resolve the Naming Conflict
If a duplicate declaration is found, you have two options:

Option A: Rename the Local Declaration
Action: Change the name of the local variable, constant, or type to avoid the conflict.
Example:

Copy
// Before
import { STSParameters } from "@shared/schema";
const STSParameters = someValue; // Conflict!

// After
import { STSParameters } from "@shared/schema";
const stsParams = someValue; // No conflict
Update: Replace all references to the old name (e.g., STSParameters) with the new name (e.g., stsParams) in the file.
Option B: Alias the Imported Type
Action: Import STSParameters with an alias to differentiate it from the local declaration.
Example:
typescript

Copy
// Before
import { STSParameters, DoubleProgressionParameters, RPTTopSetParameters, RPTIndividualParameters } from "@shared/schema";
const STSParameters = someValue; // Conflict!

// After
import { STSParameters as STSParams, DoubleProgressionParameters, RPTTopSetParameters, RPTIndividualParameters } from "@shared/schema";
const STSParameters = someValue; // No conflict
Update: Replace all uses of STSParameters (referring to the type) with STSParams in the file, while keeping the local declaration as STSParameters.
