### Resolving the "Failed to Resolve Import" Error in `workout-day-form.tsx`

The error you're encountering when trying to boot the page—specifically, `Failed to resolve import "../hooks/useExercises" from "client/src/components/workout-day-form.tsx". Does the file exist?`—indicates that Vite, the build tool used by your project, cannot locate the file `useExercises` at the specified import path `../hooks/useExercises`. This issue is preventing your application from starting correctly. Let’s break this down and provide a solution.

#### Understanding the Error
The file `workout-day-form.tsx` is located in `client/src/components/`, and it’s attempting to import `useExercises` from `../hooks/useExercises`. In a typical React project structure:
- `../` moves up one directory from `client/src/components/` to `client/src/`.
- `hooks/useExercises` then points to `client/src/hooks/useExercises`.

Thus, the expected file should be either:
- `client/src/hooks/useExercises.ts` (TypeScript file), or
- `client/src/hooks/useExercises.tsx` (TypeScript with JSX).

The error suggests that this file does not exist at that location, causing Vite to fail during the pre-transform step.

#### Steps to Fix the Issue
Since I don’t have access to your full codebase, I’ll assume that `useExercises` is intended to be a custom hook that provides exercise data (e.g., an array of exercises) to your `WorkoutDayForm` component. Here’s how we can resolve this:

##### 1. Verify the File’s Existence
First, check your project directory at `client/src/hooks/`:
- Look for a file named `useExercises.ts` or `useExercises.tsx`.
- If it exists, ensure the import path in `workout-day-form.tsx` matches exactly (e.g., case sensitivity matters: `useExercises` vs. `UseExercises`).

If the file is missing, that’s the root cause, and we’ll need to create it.

##### 2. Create the `useExercises` Hook
If `client/src/hooks/useExercises.ts` (or `.tsx`) doesn’t exist, you’ll need to create it. Below is a simple implementation of the `useExercises` hook that returns a static list of exercises. This will resolve the import error and allow your page to boot. You can later modify it to fetch data from an API or another source as per your project’s requirements.

Create a new file at `client/src/hooks/useExercises.ts` with the following content:

```typescript
import { useState } from "react";
import { Exercise } from "../types";

export const useExercises = () => {
  const [exercises] = useState<Exercise[]>([
    { id: "1", name: "Squat" },
    { id: "2", name: "Bench Press" },
    { id: "3", name: "Deadlift" },
  ]);
  return { exercises };
};
```

**Explanation:**
- This hook uses React’s `useState` to define a static array of exercises.
- It returns an object `{ exercises }`, which matches the expected usage in your component (e.g., `const { exercises } = useExercises()`).
- The `Exercise` type is imported from `../types`, which we’ll define next.

##### 3. Define the `Exercise` Type
The hook assumes an `Exercise` interface exists in `client/src/types.ts`. If this file or type doesn’t exist, create or update `client/src/types.ts` with:

```typescript
export interface Exercise {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}
```

This basic type includes `id` and `name` properties, which align with the dummy data in the hook. Adjust this interface based on your project’s actual exercise data structure (e.g., add fields like `description` or `category` if needed).

##### 4. Verify the Import in `workout-day-form.tsx`
Ensure that `workout-day-form.tsx` imports the hook correctly:

```typescript
import { useExercises } from "../hooks/useExercises";
```

Then, it likely uses it like this:

```typescript
const { exercises } = useExercises();
```

If your component uses `useExercises` differently, adjust the hook’s return value accordingly.

##### 5. Test the Application
After creating the hook and type:
- Save all files.
- Restart your development server (`npm run dev` or equivalent).
- Check if the error persists.

The page should now boot without the import resolution error, displaying the static exercises from the hook.

#### Alternative Scenarios
If `useExercises` isn’t meant to be a hook in your project:
- **Exercises via Props:** If `WorkoutDayForm` receives exercises as props from a parent component (e.g., `WorkoutsPage`), remove the `useExercises` import and update `workout-day-form.tsx` to use props instead:
  ```typescript
  interface WorkoutDayFormProps {
    exercises: Exercise[];
  }

  const WorkoutDayForm = ({ exercises }: WorkoutDayFormProps) => {
    // Use exercises directly
  };
  ```
- **Different Hook Location:** If the hook exists elsewhere (e.g., `client/src/lib/hooks/useExercises.ts`), update the import path:
  ```typescript
  import { useExercises } from "../../lib/hooks/useExercises";
  ```
- **API-Fetched Data:** If exercises come from an API, modify `useExercises` to fetch them:
  ```typescript
  import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
  import { Exercise } from "../types";

  export const useExercises = () => {
    const [exercises, setExercises] = useState<Exercise[]>([]);
    useEffect(() => {
      fetch("/api/exercises")
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((data) => setExercises(data));
    }, []);
    return { exercises };
  };
  ```

#### Final Notes
The solution above assumes a missing `useExercises` hook and provides a quick fix with dummy data. If your project has a specific way of managing exercises (e.g., via context, Redux, or an API), let me know, and I can tailor the solution further. For now, creating `client/src/hooks/useExercises.ts` as outlined should resolve the error and get your page running.

After implementing this, your development server logs should no longer show the "Failed to resolve import" error, and the application should start successfully on port 5000.
