Based on the error message you encountered in the RFGrok app—"Error saving workout 400: {"error":"value.tolSOString is not a function"}"—when clicking "save and exit" on a workout, the issue appears to be a typo in the JavaScript code. The error indicates that the app is trying to call a method named `tolSOString` on an object, but this method does not exist. The intended method is almost certainly `toISOString`, a standard JavaScript method used to convert a `Date` object to an ISO string format (e.g., "2023-10-05T14:30:00.000Z"). This kind of typo would cause the exact error you’re seeing: "is not a function," because `tolSOString` is not a valid function.

Unfortunately, as an AI, I cannot directly access your GitHub repository at `https://github.com/JABurt89/RFGrok` to inspect the code. However, I can provide a complete and actionable solution based on the error message and typical patterns in JavaScript applications like RFGrok. The error likely occurs in the client-side code responsible for preparing workout data to be sent to the server, where a date value needs to be serialized. The 400 Bad Request status suggests the server rejected the request, possibly because the client sent malformed data due to this typo, though the specific error message might be generated client-side before the request is even sent.

Here’s how you can find and fix the issue in your project:

---

### Steps to Fix the Issue

#### 1. Locate the Typo in Your Codebase
The error stems from a call to `tolSOString` instead of `toISOString`. Since I can’t see your repository, you’ll need to search for this typo in your code:

- **Action:** Open your project in a code editor (e.g., VS Code) and use the search functionality (Ctrl+F or Cmd+F) to look for the exact string `tolSOString` across all files.
- **Where to Look:** Focus on JavaScript files related to saving workouts. This could be in:
  - Frontend components (e.g., React or Angular components handling the "save and exit" button).
  - Utility or service files that prepare or serialize workout data.
  - Files with names like `workout.js`, `api.js`, or anything tied to data submission.

The problematic code likely resembles something like this:
```javascript
const workoutData = {
  date: someDate.tolSOString(),
  // ... other fields
};
```
or
```javascript
const dateString = value.tolSOString();
```

#### 2. Correct the Typo
Once you find the instance of `tolSOString`, replace it with `toISOString`. Here’s an example of what to look for and how to fix it:

- **Incorrect Code (Look for This):**
  ```javascript
  const workoutData = {
    name: workoutName,
    date: someDate.tolSOString(),
    exercises: workoutExercises
  };
  ```

- **Corrected Code (Replace With This):**
  ```javascript
  const workoutData = {
    name: workoutName,
    date: someDate.toISOString(),
    exercises: workoutExercises
  };
  ```

#### 3. Verify the Variable is a `Date` Object
The `toISOString` method only works on `Date` objects. If `someDate` (or whatever variable is used) isn’t a `Date` object, you’ll need to convert it first. Here’s how to handle different scenarios:

- **If It’s Already a `Date` Object:** No change needed beyond fixing the typo.
- **If It’s a String (e.g., from User Input):**
  ```javascript
  const workoutData = {
    name: workoutName,
    date: new Date(someDate).toISOString(),
    exercises: workoutExercises
  };
  ```
- **If It’s Undefined or Null:** Add a check to avoid errors:
  ```javascript
  const workoutData = {
    name: workoutName,
    date: someDate ? new Date(someDate).toISOString() : null,
    exercises: workoutExercises
  };
  ```

#### 4. Test the Fix
- Save the corrected file.
- Rebuild or reload your app (e.g., run `npm start` or refresh the browser if it’s a web app).
- Test the "save and exit" functionality to confirm the error is gone and the workout saves correctly.

### Complete Fix with Copy-Pastable Code
Since I can’t pinpoint the exact file or line without access to your repository, here’s a generalized example of the code you’re likely dealing with and how to fix it. Search your codebase for a similar pattern and apply this correction:

#### Likely Original Code (Search for Something Like This):
```javascript
// In a file like src/components/WorkoutForm.js or src/services/workoutService.js
function saveWorkout(workout) {
  const workoutData = {
    id: workout.id,
    date: workout.date.tolSOString(), // Typo causing the error
    duration: workout.duration,
    exercises: workout.exercises
  };

  return fetch('/api/workouts', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(workoutData)
  })
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Error saving workout ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    return response.json();
  });
}

// Example usage
document.getElementById('saveExitButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
  const workout = {
    id: 1,
    date: new Date(), // Assuming this is a Date object
    duration: 60,
    exercises: ['Push-ups', 'Squats']
  };
  saveWorkout(workout).catch(err => console.error(err));
});
```

#### Fixed Code (Replace With This):
```javascript
// In a file like src/components/WorkoutForm.js or src/services/workoutService.js
function saveWorkout(workout) {
  const workoutData = {
    id: workout.id,
    date: workout.date.toISOString(), // Corrected method name
    duration: workout.duration,
    exercises: workout.exercises
  };

  return fetch('/api/workouts', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(workoutData)
  })
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Error saving workout ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    return response.json();
  });
}

// Example usage
document.getElementById('saveExitButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
  const workout = {
    id: 1,
    date: new Date(), // Assuming this is a Date object
    duration: 60,
    exercises: ['Push-ups', 'Squats']
  };
  saveWorkout(workout).catch(err => console.error(err));
});
```

#### If the Date Comes from a String (Alternative Fix):
If `workout.date` is a string (e.g., "2023-10-05"), use this version:
```javascript
function saveWorkout(workout) {
  const workoutData = {
    id: workout.id,
    date: new Date(workout.date).toISOString(), // Convert string to Date, then to ISO string
    duration: workout.duration,
    exercises: workout.exercises
  };

  return fetch('/api/workouts', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(workoutData)
  })
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Error saving workout ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);
    }
    return response.json();
  });
}
```

### Additional Troubleshooting
- **If You Can’t Find `tolSOString`:** It’s possible the typo is in a minified file, a library, or dynamically generated code. Double-check all JavaScript files, and if necessary, search for similar misspellings (e.g., `tolS0String`, `toIS0String`).
- **If the Error Persists:** After fixing the typo, if you get a different error (e.g., "toISOString is not a function"), log the variable to the console (`console.log(workout.date)`) to check its type. Adjust the code to ensure it’s a `Date` object.
- **Server Response Check:** The 400 error suggests the server rejected the request. After fixing the client-side typo, ensure the server expects an ISO-formatted date string.

### Final Notes
This fix assumes the error occurs in the client-side code of RFGrok when preparing data for a save operation. By correcting `tolSOString` to `toISOString` and ensuring the variable is a `Date` object, the "save and exit" functionality should work as intended. If you’re still encountering issues or want me to refine the solution further, please share the relevant code snippet from your repository, and I can provide a more precise fix tailored to your project.
