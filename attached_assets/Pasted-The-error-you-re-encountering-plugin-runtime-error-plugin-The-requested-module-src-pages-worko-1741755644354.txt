The error you're encountering, `[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] The requested module '/src/pages/workouts-page.tsx' does not provide an export named 'default'`, indicates that Vite (your build tool) is expecting a default export from `src/pages/workouts-page.tsx`, but the file is using a named export instead. This mismatch typically occurs in React applications when the routing or module import system assumes a default export (e.g., `export default WorkoutsPage`), but the file exports the component as a named export (e.g., `export function WorkoutsPage`).

### Why This Happens
In your updated `workouts-page.tsx` file (from my previous response), I wrote:
```tsx
export function WorkoutsPage() { ... }
```
This is a **named export**. However, your app’s routing setup (likely in `main.tsx` or a similar entry point) or Vite’s configuration might be importing it as a default export, like:
```tsx
import WorkoutsPage from './pages/workouts-page.tsx';
```
When Vite or React Router expects `WorkoutsPage` to be the default export but finds only a named export, it throws this error.

### How to Fix It
You have two options:
1. **Change to a Default Export**: Modify `workouts-page.tsx` to use a default export, which aligns with common React conventions for page components.
2. **Adjust the Import**: Update the import statement wherever `WorkoutsPage` is used to use the named export syntax.

Since your app’s structure (based on the GitHub repo `https://github.com/JABurt89/RFGrok`) suggests a standard React setup with Vite, the simplest and most conventional fix is to use a default export in `workouts-page.tsx`. This aligns with how most React routing libraries (e.g., React Router) and Vite setups handle page components.

### Specific Instructions

#### 1. Update `src/pages/workouts-page.tsx`
Change the named export to a default export by adding `export default` at the bottom of the file. Here’s the corrected code:

```tsx
// src/pages/workouts-page.tsx
import { useState } from "react";
import { WorkoutDayForm } from "../components/workout-day-form";
import { Sheet, SheetContent, SheetTrigger } from "../components/ui/sheet";
import { Button } from "../components/ui/button";

interface WorkoutDay {
  name: string;
  exercises: { name: string; scheme: string; restBetweenSets: number; restBetweenExercises: number }[];
}

function WorkoutsPage() {
  const [workouts, setWorkouts] = useState<WorkoutDay[]>([]);
  const [isSheetOpen, setIsSheetOpen] = useState(false);

  const submitWorkoutDay = (data: WorkoutDay) => {
    console.log("Workout day submitted:", data); // Debug log
    setWorkouts((prev) => [...prev, data]); // Add new workout to state
    setIsSheetOpen(false); // Close the sheet after submission
  };

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Workouts</h1>
      <Sheet open={isSheetOpen} onOpenChange={setIsSheetOpen}>
        <SheetTrigger asChild>
          <Button onClick={() => setIsSheetOpen(true)}>Add Workout Day</Button>
        </SheetTrigger>
        <SheetContent>
          <WorkoutDayForm submitWorkoutDay={submitWorkoutDay} />
        </SheetContent>
      </Sheet>

      <div className="mt-4">
        {workouts.length === 0 ? (
          <p>No workouts yet.</p>
        ) : (
          workouts.map((workout, index) => (
            <div key={index} className="mb-4 p-4 border rounded">
              <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold">{workout.name}</h2>
              <ul>
                {workout.exercises.map((exercise, idx) => (
                  <li key={idx}>
                    {exercise.name} ({exercise.scheme}) - Rest: {exercise.restBetweenSets}s / {exercise.restBetweenExercises}s
                  </li>
                ))}
              </ul>
            </div>
          ))
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default WorkoutsPage;
```

**Changes Made:**
- Removed `export` from `export function WorkoutsPage()` and replaced it with a standalone `function WorkoutsPage()`.
- Added `export default WorkoutsPage;` at the end of the file to make `WorkoutsPage` the default export.

#### 2. Verify the Import
Check where `WorkoutsPage` is imported (likely in `src/main.tsx` or a routes file). It should look like this:
```tsx
import WorkoutsPage from './pages/workouts-page.tsx';
```
This syntax is correct for a default export and should now work without errors.

If you’re using a routing library like React Router, ensure the route definition uses the imported component correctly, e.g.:
```tsx
<Route path="/workouts" element={<WorkoutsPage />} />
```

#### 3. Test the Fix
1. Save the updated `workouts-page.tsx` file.
2. Restart your development server (`npm run dev` or equivalent) to ensure Vite picks up the change.
3. Navigate to the workouts page in your app and confirm the error is gone.
4. Test the "Create Workout" button again to ensure it still works as expected (logs data and adds the workout).

### Alternative Fix (If You Prefer Named Exports)
If you’d rather keep `WorkoutsPage` as a named export, you’d need to adjust the import wherever it’s used. For example, change:
```tsx
import WorkoutsPage from './pages/workouts-page.tsx';
```
to:
```tsx
import { WorkoutsPage } from './pages/workouts-page.tsx';
```
However, this requires updating every file that imports `WorkoutsPage`, and it might not align with your app’s existing conventions. The default export approach is recommended for simplicity and consistency with React/Vite norms.

### Additional Notes
- **HMR Overlay**: The error message suggests you can disable the overlay by setting `server.hmr.overlay` to `false` in `vite.config.js`. This won’t fix the export issue but can hide the overlay if it’s distracting:
  ```js
  // vite.config.js
  export default {
    server: {
      hmr: {
        overlay: false,
      },
    },
    // ...other config
  };
  ```
- **Repo Consistency**: Your GitHub repo (`https://github.com/JABurt89/RFGrok`) didn’t show a `main.tsx` or routing setup, so I assumed a typical Vite/React structure. If your setup differs significantly, let me know, and I’ll adjust the fix.
