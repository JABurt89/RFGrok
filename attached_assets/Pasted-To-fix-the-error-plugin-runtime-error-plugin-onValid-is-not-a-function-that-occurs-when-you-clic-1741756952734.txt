To fix the error "[plugin:runtime-error-plugin] onValid is not a function" that occurs when you click the "Create Workout" button in your workout app hosted at https://github.com/JABurt89/RFGrok, I’ve analyzed the issue based on common patterns in web development, particularly with Vite-based applications (as indicated by the error message). Since I cannot directly access the repository to pinpoint the exact file and line, I’ll provide a complete, actionable solution with copy-pastable code by making reasonable assumptions about your app’s structure. The error suggests that a function named `onValid` is being called but is either undefined or not a function, likely in the context of form submission or button click handling.

### Understanding the Problem
The error occurs in a Vite project during runtime, as indicated by the `[plugin:runtime-error-plugin]` prefix and the mention of `vite.config.js`. It happens when the "Create Workout" button is clicked, implying that the issue is tied to a form submission or event handler. In JavaScript (likely React, given Vite’s common use with it), this error typically means:
- A component expects a function (e.g., `onValid`) as a prop or method, but it’s missing or incorrectly defined.
- There might be a typo (e.g., `onValid` instead of `onSubmit`) or a misconfiguration in how the function is passed or invoked.

Without seeing the exact code, I’ll assume a typical scenario: a form component handles workout creation, and `onValid` is intended as a callback executed when the form is valid. The fix will ensure `onValid` is properly defined and passed.

### Steps to Fix the Issue
Since I can’t browse the repository, I’ll guide you to locate and fix the issue with a general solution that you can adapt to your specific codebase. Here’s how to resolve it:

1. **Locate the "Create Workout" Button Code**
   - Open your project in a code editor or use GitHub’s search feature at https://github.com/JABurt89/RFGrok.
   - Search for `"Create Workout"` to find the button or form component responsible for triggering the action.

2. **Identify the `onValid` Usage**
   - Look for `onValid` in the component containing the "Create Workout" button or its parent/child components. It might appear in a form submission handler or as a prop.

3. **Apply the Fix**
   - Ensure `onValid` is defined as a function and correctly integrated into the component hierarchy.

### Assumed Scenario and Solution
Let’s assume your app has a structure where a `WorkoutForm` component handles the form, and a parent component (e.g., `CreateWorkoutPage`) passes a callback to it. The error suggests `onValid` is called but not provided or defined properly. Here’s a complete fix:

#### Parent Component: `CreateWorkoutPage.jsx`
This component renders the form and provides the `onValid` callback.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import WorkoutForm from './WorkoutForm'; // Adjust the import path as needed

function CreateWorkoutPage() {
  // Define the onValid function to handle form submission
  const handleWorkoutCreation = (formData) => {
    console.log('Workout created with data:', formData);
    // Add your logic here, e.g., API call to save the workout
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Create a New Workout</h1>
      <WorkoutForm onValid={handleWorkoutCreation} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default CreateWorkoutPage;
```

#### Child Component: `WorkoutForm.jsx`
This component contains the form and calls `onValid` when the form is submitted successfully.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function WorkoutForm({ onValid }) {
  // Example form state (adjust fields to match your app)
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: '',
    duration: '',
  });

  const handleChange = (e) => {
    const { name, value } = e.target;
    setFormData((prev) => ({ ...prev, [name]: value }));
  };

  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    // Basic validation (customize as needed)
    const formIsValid = formData.name && formData.duration;
    if (formIsValid) {
      // Call onValid with the form data
      if (typeof onValid === 'function') {
        onValid(formData);
      } else {
        console.error('onValid is not a function. Please ensure it is passed correctly.');
      }
    } else {
      console.log('Form validation failed');
    }
  };

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <div>
        <label>
          Workout Name:
          <input
            type="text"
            name="name"
            value={formData.name}
            onChange={handleChange}
          />
        </label>
      </div>
      <div>
        <label>
          Duration (minutes):
          <input
            type="number"
            name="duration"
            value={formData.duration}
            onChange={handleChange}
          />
        </label>
      </div>
      <button type="submit">Create Workout</button>
    </form>
  );
}

export default WorkoutForm;
```

### How to Apply This Fix
1. **Find the Relevant Files**
   - Check your project for files like `CreateWorkoutPage.jsx`, `WorkoutForm.jsx`, or similar components related to workout creation. They might be in a `src/components/` or `src/pages/` directory.

2. **Replace or Update the Code**
   - If you have a parent component rendering the form, update it to match the `CreateWorkoutPage.jsx` example, ensuring `onValid` is passed as a function.
   - If you have a form component, update it to match `WorkoutForm.jsx`, ensuring `onValid` is received as a prop and called correctly.

3. **Test the Fix**
   - Run your app (`npm run dev` if using Vite), click "Create Workout," and verify the error is gone. The console should log the form data if the submission works.

### Debugging If the Error Persists
If the above doesn’t match your setup, or the error remains:
- **Check the Console**: Open your browser’s developer tools (F12), go to the "Console" tab, and note the stack trace when the error occurs. It will point to the exact file and line.
- **Search for `onValid`**: Use your editor or GitHub search to find all instances of `onValid`. If it’s a typo (e.g., meant to be `onSubmit`), rename it:
  ```jsx
  // Change this
  onValid={someHandler}
  // To this, if appropriate
  onSubmit={someHandler}
  ```
- **Add a Safety Check**: Before calling `onValid`, verify it’s a function:
  ```jsx
  if (typeof onValid === 'function') {
    onValid(formData);
  }
  ```

### Why This Works
The error "onValid is not a function" means the code attempts to invoke `onValid()` when it’s undefined or not a function. By:
- Defining `handleWorkoutCreation` as a function in the parent component.
- Passing it as the `onValid` prop to the form.
- Ensuring the form calls `onValid` only if it’s a function, we eliminate the runtime error.

### Final Notes
- Adjust `formData` fields (e.g., `name`, `duration`) to match your workout app’s requirements.
- If your app uses a form library (e.g., Formik, React Hook Form), let me know, and I can tailor the solution further.
- If `onValid` isn’t the intended name and you find a different callback (e.g., `onSuccess`), replace `onValid` with the correct name in both components.

This solution should resolve the issue. Copy and paste the code into your project, adapting paths and field names as needed, and you should no longer see the error when clicking "Create Workout."
